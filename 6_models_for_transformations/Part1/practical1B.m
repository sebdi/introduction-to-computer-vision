function practical1B

%the aim of the second part of practical 1 is to use the homography routine
%that you established in the first part of the practical.  We are going to
%make a panorama of several images that are related by a homography.  I
%provide 3 images (one of which is has a large surrounding region) and a
%matching set of points between these images.

%close all open figures
close all;

%load in the required data
load('PracticalData','im1','im2','im3','pts1','pts2','pts3','pts1b');
%im1 is center image with grey background
%im2 is left image 
%pts1 and pts2 are matching points between image1 and image2
%im3 is right image
%pts1b and pts3 are matching points between image 1 and image 3

%show images and points
figure; set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);image(uint8(im1));axis off;hold on;axis image;
plot(pts1(1,:),pts1(2,:),'r.'); 
plot(pts1b(1,:),pts1b(2,:),'m.');
figure; set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);image(uint8(im2));axis off;hold on;axis image;
plot(pts2(1,:),pts2(2,:),'r.'); 
figure; set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);image(uint8(im3));axis off;hold on;axis image;
plot(pts3(1,:),pts3(2,:),'m.'); 

%****TO DO**** 
%calculate homography from pts1 to pts2

%****TO DO**** 
%for every pixel in image 1
    %transform this pixel position with your homography to find where it 
    %is in the coordinates of image 2
    %if it the transformed position is within the boundary of image 2 then 
        %copy pixel colour from image 2 pixel to current position in image 1 
        %draw new image1 (use drawnow to force it to draw)
    %end
%end;

%****TO DO****
%repeat the above process mapping image 3 to image 1.

function r=practical2

%This project explores the geometry of a single camera. The aim is to take several points on
%a plane, and predict where they will appear in the camera image. Based on these observed
%points, we will then try to re-estimate the Euclidean transformation relating the plane and
%the camera. In practical 2b we will use this code to draw a wireframe cube
%on an augmented reality marker.   You should use this
%template for your code and fill in the missing sections marked "TO DO"


%We assume that the intrinsic camera matrix K is known and has values
K = [640  0    320;...
     0    640  240;
     0    0    1];
 
%We will assume an object co-ordinate system with the Z-axis pointing upwards and the
%origin in the centre of the plane. There are four known points on the plane, with coordinates
%(in mm):

XCart = [-100 -100  100  100 0 ;...
         -100  100  100 -100 0;...
          0    0    0    0   0 ];

%We will assume that the correct transformation from the plane co-ordinate system to the
%camera co-ordinate system (extrinsic matrix) is:

T = [ 0.9851  -0.0492  0.1619  46.00;...
     -0.1623  -0.5520  0.8181  70.00;...
      0.0490  -0.8324 -0.5518  500.89;...
      0        0       0       1]
  
% Use the general pin-hole projective camera model discussed in the lectures to estimate 
%where the four points on the plane will appear in the image.  Fill in the
%details of the function "projectiveCamera" - body of function appears below

xImCart = projectiveCamera(K,T,XCart);

% Add noise to the pixel positions to simulate having to find these points in a noisy
%image. Store the results back in xImCart.  
%The noise should have standard deviation of one pixel in each direction.
xImCart=xImCart+0.1*randn(2,5);

%Now we will take the image points and the known positions on the card and try to
%estimate the extrinsic matrix using the algorithm discussed in the lecture. 
%Fill in the details of the function "estimate plane pose" - body of function appears
%below

TEst = estimatePlanePose(xImCart,XCart,K)

%if you have got this correct, it should resemble T above.
